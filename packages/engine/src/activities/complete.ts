/**
 * Activity completion unit-of-work — the wired write path (Lane A · T-A2.5 · cq.16).
 *
 * ── Why this file exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The atomic seam `makePostgresAtomicCompletion(...).grantAndComplete(...)`
 * (packages/adapters/src/postgres/atomic-completion.ts) restores the legacy
 * stored proc's single-transaction atomicity for {CAS event-append →
 * reward_grants → apply_resource_mutation}. It is proven by the T-A2 crash-
 * injection + idempotency suites. But NO engine caller invoked it — the engine
 * shipped only the standalone lifecycle / retry / port surface, so a real
 * completion still had only the NAÏVE two-transaction append-then-grant.
 *
 * This file is the missing caller. It takes a completion, computes the canonical
 * `ActivityCompleted` event, dispatches on the {@link ActivityReward} tag, and:
 *
 *   - **Resource** → resolves recipient → userAddress via {@link IdentityResolverPort}
 *     BEFORE the txn opens (the seam must hold the txn open as briefly as
 *     possible — identity resolution may be a network call), translates the
 *     reward → {@link ResourceMutationDelta}, and calls `grantAndComplete` with
 *     `resourceIdempotencyKey = event_id` (the seam enforces this by default).
 *     The event-append + grant + ledger mutation become durable together, in
 *     ONE SERIALIZABLE transaction. Idempotent on replay (same event_id).
 *
 *   - **BadgeMint / TokenAmount / Cosmetic / External** → delivery is NOT yet
 *     wired (BadgeMint forwards to the future freeside-mint sibling; the others
 *     have no delivery seam at all). We DO NOT crash and we DO NOT report a
 *     false grant. Instead we append the `ActivityCompleted` event and record a
 *     {@link RewardPendingEvent} (the wire envelope around RewardState.Pending),
 *     then return a sealed {@link CompletionDeferred} outcome. The completion is
 *     durable; the reward is parked in Pending for a future delivery wave.
 *
 *   - **None** → "completion is the reward" (CL-Reward-1). Routed through the
 *     atomic seam with a `{0,0,0}` delta — the proc short-circuits (no ledger
 *     row) but the event appends and a grant row is still recorded.
 *
 * ── What this is NOT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * - NOT an HTTP write route. GATE-SEC-1 gates the network write surface; this is
 *   an INVOKABLE engine function (Effect) so Phase-3 can wire it behind whatever
 *   the gate requires. No express / fastify / route handler is added here.
 * - NOT a replacement for the standalone ports. The read path
 *   (CompletionEventPort.query, RewardPort.query) and the standalone seams stay
 *   intact and untouched.
 * - NOT a place that hardcodes "every reward is a Resource". The dispatch is on
 *   the reward `_tag`; the Resource branch is the only one with a wired delivery
 *   TODAY, and the design makes adding the BadgeMint delivery later a localized
 *   change (replace the deferred branch's body).

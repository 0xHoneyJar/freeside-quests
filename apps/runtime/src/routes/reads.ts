/**
 * Activity-supertype READ routes (SDD §5 · FR-A1) — the read plane, mirroring
 * the 5 declared beacon capabilities + a progress lookup. Backed by the
 * Seam-B Postgres adapters (T-A1) via the composition root.
 *
 * ── SECURITY (hardened per the activities-api PR #21 read-plane review) ───────
 *
 * AUTH (#1, CRITICAL): every DATA route now carries `.use(requireIdentity)` —
 * a valid identity-api Bearer JWT (HS256, iss=identity-api) is MANDATORY. No
 * token / bad token → 401 (the gate short-circuits before the handler). Only
 * `/health` + `/.well-known/beacon.json` stay public.
 *
 * IDENTITY/WORLD SCOPE (#2, CRITICAL): the queried identity is the
 * AUTHENTICATED identity from the verified token (`identityOf(req).identity_id`,
 * = the JWT `sub`), NEVER a caller-supplied query param. The `identity_id`
 * query param is GONE from /v1/progress and /v1/badges. A caller can only ever
 * read their OWN identity's data. The token's `tenant` claim is the WORLD scope
 * (`identityOf(req).world`) — a caller cannot read cross-world either (an
 * identity is minted into exactly one world per token; events are read filtered
 * to that identity, so the per-identity predicate subsumes world isolation for
 * this deployment's event shape — see WORLD-SCOPE note below).
 *
 * DoS (#3, HIGH): each list route accepts a CLAMPED `limit` query param
 * (DEFAULT_LIMIT default, MAX_LIMIT hard cap) threaded into EventFilter.limit →
 * SQL `LIMIT`. Combined with the JSONB index in the migration, no read can
 * trigger an unbounded scan.
 *
 * PAGINATION (#4, MEDIUM): the MCP/OpenAPI contract advertises
 * { items, next_cursor, total_count }. We keep ALL THREE and make them HONEST:
 *   - `total_count` is the real (bounded) count of items in THIS page.
 *   - `next_cursor` is an opaque cursor (the last item's event_id) when the
 *     page is FULL (items.length === limit ⇒ more may exist); `null` when the
 *     page is short (definitively the last page). The prior code hard-coded
 *     next_cursor=null and total_count=page-size unconditionally — which lied
 *     ("there's never a next page" + "count is the page size"). This is the
 *     honest minimum the CompletionEventPort.query projection supports; a fully
 *     keyset-signed cursor (packages/mcp-tools/src/pagination/cursor.ts) lands
 *     when the query port exposes monotonic_sequence in its projection.
 *
 * WORLD-SCOPE note: ActivityCompleted events do NOT carry a top-level
 * world/tenant field (the world dimension lives in PartitionKey scope —
 * PartitionScope "world"/"composite", IMP-016). This deployment partitions by
 * "activity" scope, so the row has no world discriminant to filter on. The
 * load-bearing isolation is therefore the per-identity SQL predicate (an
 * identity belongs to one world's token). The world claim is asserted-present
 * on every authed read and is the seam for a world-partition predicate once
 * composite (world::activity) partitioning is wired.
 *
 * READ-ONLY: each route calls ONLY the query side of a port. Write routes
 * (completion / grant) remain absent (G-4 parity gate + GATE-SEC-1).
